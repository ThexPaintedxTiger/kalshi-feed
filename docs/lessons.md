# Lessons

What we changed because the data (or a mistake) taught us something. Newest first.

- 2026-11-10 (**leak caught**): Backtest v1 picked the most-traded market per event. The eventual winner's market gathers the most
  volume, so the sample was tilted toward YES (YES won 55% vs 45.6% average price over 302 markets). Memory learned that false gap and
  the live memory predictor made 11 YES picks in config v2. Fix (config v3): choose markets within an event by a fixed ticker hash and judge
  liquidity per event; backtest v1 data was discarded (still in git history); every backtest now reports `sampleCheck` and warns on a
  gap > 5 points. Config-v2 live rows stay as logged (never edited) and are labeled `cfg: 2`. Lesson: **any selection rule that uses
  data from after the prediction time is leakage, even if it's only used to choose which markets to study.**

- 2026-11-10: The dashboard hid a render error behind "couldn't load data" (one try/catch around fetch and render). Fetch and render errors are now separate and shown.
- 2026-11-10: A predictor that can't act yet (memory with no history) scored "no measurable difference", which reads like a finding. Added verdict "same as market (not active yet)".
- 2026-11-10: Backtest picked both sides of two-way games; they're near-duplicates. Now one market per event in the backtest.

- 2026-11-10: An unquoted skill description containing ": " broke its YAML front matter; caught by the parse check. Always quote descriptions.

- 2026-11-10: Ranking only by volume filled 75 of 80 slots with sports. Now round-robin across categories.
- 2026-11-10: Without a ticker and an append-only log, picks can never be scored. Log first, analyze later.
